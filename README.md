eyeballs_rails is a gem for using eyeballs.js in your Ruby on Rails projects.

eyeballs_rails brings the `eyeballs_javascripts` method to Rails, which wraps `javascript_include_tags` but also includes all of the eyeballs.js dependencies, including jQuery and mustache. It also includes all of your models and controllers.
